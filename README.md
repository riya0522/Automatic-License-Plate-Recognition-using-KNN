# Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-KNN

Character Recognition in license plates plays a crucial role in Road Safety. It helps in tracing stolen cars, finding parking slots, etc. Here we present a solution for apartment security using automatic recognition of license plates of vehicles from video feed. We used a simple approach of licence plate detection from multiple frames and applying machine learning algorithm (KNN) on it to improve the efficiency. Real time video stream is fed to the model and the license plate is recognized.This helps in monitoring the movement of vehicles moving in and out of the apartment areas. Automatic License Plate Recognition(ALPR), Optical Character Recognition (OCR), classic machine learning, bounding box(ground truth).
This was a mini project completed as part of 6th Semester in B.Tech with specialization in Information Technology during January â€“ May, 2020.

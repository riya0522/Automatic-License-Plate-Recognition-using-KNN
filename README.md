# Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-using-KNN

Character Recognition in license plates plays a crucial role in Road Safety. It helps in tracing stolen cars, finding parking slots, etc. Here we present a solution for apartment security using automatic recognition of license plates of vehicles from video feed. We used a simple approach of licence plate detection from multiple frames and applying deep learning algorithm (KNN) on it to improve the efficiency. Real time video stream is fed to the model and the license plate is recognized.This helps in monitoring the movement of vehicles moving in and out of the apartment areas.
